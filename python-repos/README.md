180805 Python Crash Course / Chapter 17 / Plotting Python Repos in Github - fixed emoji display

This is the code from Python Crash Course Chapter 17, which plots the most popular Github Python Repos. I fixed a bug that showed error when there were emojis in the description.

Also added a test unit as per exercise 17-3.
